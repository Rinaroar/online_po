      <p>Hey there,</p>
      <br></br>
      <AboutMe>I'm Marina Luxin <br></br>Happy Product Owner</AboutMe>
      <br></br>
        <p>I started my journey in Digital World from an young age designing, editing and creating stuff on Web.
          I did my studies in Paris beginning with a HND in communication and a Bachelor Degree in Digital Marketing.
          <br/>
          I continued with a <strong>Master Degree in Web Developement</strong> at ECV Digital Paris, to improve my technical skill doing front-end development.
          <br/>
          <br/>Now Iâ€™m about to finish my <strong>Art Director Degree specialized in Digital Startagy</strong>.
          <br/>Digital culture is one of my center of interest, such as design and sport : fields where there is always something new to learn!
          <br/>
          <br/>Most of all I like to share and pass on my knowledge with the other.
